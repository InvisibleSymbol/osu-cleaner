 Clean up your osu! Library with ease (〜￣ △￣)〜

## What does it do?
Enables you to automatically filter your Beatmaps using different filters. Beatmaps that don't match any filters will be moved to a "Cleanup" folder, where they can later be removed or moved back.

## Are my Beatmaps safe?
Well I tried my best in making it foolproof. Beatmaps are copied to said "Cleanup" folder and not directly deleted, and I added a Button that reverts everything. I also don't directly access any of osu!'s databases; instead I create local copies and read those. Overkill, but better safe than sorry. **It is still your Job to make sure no important maps were deleted.**

## Where can I download this?

## Let me see those screenshots!
